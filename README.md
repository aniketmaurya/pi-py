# pi-py

Python tools for building AI agents and managing LLM deployments.

This repository is an open-source Python reimplementation of core ideas from Pi (JS/TS), starting with a provider-agnostic agent runtime that is composable and SDK-friendly.

## Status

Phase 1 is implemented:

- Core typed domain model for messages, content blocks, tools, usage, model config
- Async event stream primitive with terminal-result handling
- Agent loop runtime with turn/tool orchestration and steering/follow-up queues
- Stateful `Agent` wrapper with prompt/continue/abort/wait APIs
- Strict checks and tests (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`)

Roadmap details are tracked in [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md).

## Requirements

- Python `>=3.11`
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src tests
uv run pytest -q
```

## Package layout

```text
src/pi_py/agent_core/
  types.py         # domain model + event types + runtime protocols
  event_stream.py  # generic async stream + assistant stream specialization
  agent_loop.py    # turn execution + tool execution loop
  agent.py         # high-level agent state wrapper

src/pi_py/pi_ai/
  types.py         # provider request + provider protocol
  registry.py      # provider registry + defaults
  runtime.py       # stream/complete APIs + Agent adapter
  providers/mock.py
```

## End-to-end example

Run:

```bash
uv run python examples/agent_e2e.py
```

This example creates an `Agent`, routes model calls through the new `pi_ai` runtime layer, invokes a tool, and prints the final assistant response.
